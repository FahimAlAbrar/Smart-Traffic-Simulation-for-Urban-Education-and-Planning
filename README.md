# Smart-Traffic-Simulation-for-Urban-Education-and-Planning
Interactive graphics make learning more engaging by showing motion instead of just text or images. In Bangladeshi digital classrooms, students learn better by seeing how systems like traffic work. Our project uses a simple computer simulation to teach traffic signals, vehicle movement, and day/night changes in a city setting.
